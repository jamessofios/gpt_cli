Yes, the `jq` command can escape invalid JSON characters using the `@json` filter. The `@json` filter will return the input as a valid JSON string, escaping any special characters that are not allowed in JSON. 

For example, if you have a string that contains special characters:

```
$ echo 'Hello, "World"' | jq '@json'
```

The output will be:

```
"\"Hello, \\\"World\\\"\""
```

Here, the string has been escaped to ensure that it is a valid JSON string, which can be safely used in other JSON documents.
Yes, the `jq` command can help unescape invalid JSON characters with the `--raw-output` option. When this option is used, `jq` outputs the raw strings without any escaping. This can be useful when dealing with JSON that has invalid or escaped characters. For example, to extract a string field with escaped characters and unescape them, you can use the following `jq` command:

```
jq --raw-output '.field | @json' input.json
```

This will extract the `field` value from the `input.json` file, unescape any escaped characters, and output the result as a raw string.
