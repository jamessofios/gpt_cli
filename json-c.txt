No, json-c does not automatically escape invalid JSON characters that you give it. It is up to the user to ensure that the input data is properly formatted according to the JSON specifications.

However, json-c provides a function called `json_escape_string()` that can be used to escape special characters in a string in order to make it valid JSON. Here is an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <json-c/json.h>

int main() {
    const char *string = "This \"is\" a 'test' string.\n";
    printf("Original string: %s\n", string);

    char *escaped_string = json_escape_string(string);
    printf("Escaped string: %s\n", escaped_string);

    free(escaped_string);
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
Original string: This "is" a 'test' string.
Escaped string: This \"is\" a \'test\' string.\n
```

As you can see, the `json_escape_string()` function has escaped the quotes and the apostrophe in the original string, making it a valid JSON string.
